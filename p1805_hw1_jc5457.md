# Problem 1

**Loading the penguins dataset**

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

**Descriptions of the penguins dataset**

The variable names in this dataset are: species, island, bill_length_mm,
bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.

The table below shows the number of each species in the `species`
variable

    ##    Adelie Chinstrap    Gentoo 
    ##       152        68       124

The table below shows the number of each island type in the `island`
variable

    ##    Biscoe     Dream Torgersen 
    ##       168       124        52

The table below shows the min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile,
max value, and number of NA’s of the variable `bill_length_mm`

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##   32.10   39.23   44.45   43.92   48.50   59.60       2

The table below shows the min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile,
max value, and number of NA’s of the variable `bill_depth_mm`

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##   13.10   15.60   17.30   17.15   18.70   21.50       2

The table below shows the min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile,
max value, and number of NA’s of the variable `flipper_length_mm`

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##   172.0   190.0   197.0   200.9   213.0   231.0       2

The table below shows the min, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile,
max value, and number of NA’s of the variable `body_mass_g`

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
    ##    2700    3550    4050    4202    4750    6300       2

There are 344 rows and 8 columns.

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047

**The plot**

The scatterplot of `flipper_length_mm (y)` vs `bill_length_mm (x)` Color
points using the `species` variable

``` r
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x=bill_length_mm, 
           y=flipper_length_mm,
           color=species)) + geom_point()
```

# Problem 2

**Create a data frame** This code chunk creates a data frame comprised
of:

-   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
-   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
    greater than 0
-   a character vector of length 10
-   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
dataframe = 
  tibble(
    random_sample = rnorm(10),
    logical_vector = random_sample > 0,
    character_vector = character(length=10),
    factor_vector = factor(c("lv1","lv2","lv3",
                             "lv3","lv3","lv3",
                             "lv3","lv3","lv3","lv3"))
  )
```

**Pull the mean of each variable**

``` r
mean(pull(dataframe, random_sample))
```

    ## [1] -0.06890265

``` r
mean(pull(dataframe, logical_vector))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

``` r
mean(pull(dataframe, character_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(dataframe, character_vector)): 参数不是数值也不是逻
    ## 辑值：回覆NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(dataframe, factor_vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(dataframe, factor_vector)): 参数不是数值也不是逻辑
    ## 值：回覆NA

    ## [1] NA

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe:

-   The numeric variable `random_sample` and logical vector
    `logical_vector` work
-   The character vector `character_vector` and factor vector
    `factor_vector` don’t work

**Transfer the variables into numeric variables**

``` r
as.numeric(pull(dataframe, logical_vector))
as.numeric(pull(dataframe, character_vector))
as.numeric(pull(dataframe, factor_vector))
```

Logical and factor vectors are successfully converted to numeric
vectors. Character vector can not be converted to numeric vector.

The failure of taking mean in the above section is because only numeric
and logical vectors can take means. For logical vector, 1 represents
TRUE and 0 represents FALSE.
